# My Portfolio

## About

This repository is my professional web development portfolio. As a beginner web developer, I am hoping to show what I have learned so far and to display information about myself. My goal is to create a web page that is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and contains information relevant to any potential employers.

This web page also gave me the opportunity to practice with flexbox, psuedo elements, pseudo classes, and other CSS techniques. This page has been updated as I have learned about more technologies.

The portfolio is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://ksdevinney.github.io/probable-robot/).
