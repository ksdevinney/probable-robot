# Portfolio

![screenshot of deployed page](assets/images/full-page-screenshot.png)

This repository is my professional web development portfolio. As a beginner web developer, I am hoping to show what I have learned so far (primarily HTML and CSS) to display information about myself. My goal is to create a web page that is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and contains information relevant to any potential employers.
This web page also gave me the opportunity to practice with flexbox, psuedo elements, pseudo classes, and other CSS techniques. I hope to refine this page as I learn more and practice with other languages.
