                    I am an SMU undergraduate with a degree in English. I have spent the past 8 years teaching
                    elementary school, and now I am diving into web development. Computers have always been a hobby of
                    mine, so I am excited to turn my passion into my career! Currently, I am enrolled in SMU's coding
                    boot camp and excited to launch a new career soon!
